* vterms.el

Associate vterm buffers to regular Emacs buffers.

Quickly recall the matching vterm buffer after switching buffers or projects.

** Configuration

#+begin_src emacs-lisp :tangle yes
  (use-package vterms
    :bind (("C-c v v" . vterms-switch)
           ("C-c v p" . vterms-new-in-project-root)
           ("C-c v d" . vterms-new)
           ("C-c v z" . vterms-repeat)
           ("C-c v o" . vterms-window))
#+end_src

** Usage

*** vterms-switch

Display a Vterm buffer associated with the current buffer.

*** vterms-new

Create a Vterm buffer associated with the current buffer.

The Vterm buffer will start in the directory where the current buffer's file is located. It will also be named after
this directory.

*** vterms-new-in-project-root

Like `vterms-new` but opens the Vterm in the current project's root directory.

*** vterms-repeat

Clear a visible Vterm and re-submit the last command to it.

*** vterms-window

Select a visible Vterm window.
